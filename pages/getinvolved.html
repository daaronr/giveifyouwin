              <p>
                Your organisation will contribute to society through advancing research and
                promoting charitable giving. This is a great means of going beyond the regulatory
                minimum and showing good will in a post-2008 world.

                Some of the research can be <b>tailored towards your organisation's specific goals</b>. You will gain
                from sharing ideas and tools with innovative researchers, which can help you achieve your
                organisation's goals.

          <h2 class="text-center">Example design for an implementation</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Fundraisers make specific appeals to employees who anticipate an unknown potential bonus
          being revealed and awarded at a certain time (e.g. 25 December). We will randomly assign employees
          into three groups.</p>
            <ul>
              <li style="text-align:justify"><b>A1 - </b><i>‘Give from known bonus’</i>:  These employees are asked on 10 January, after they
                know their bonus, to donate a portion of it, to be collected in one week (17 January).</li><br>
              <li style="text-align:justify"><b>A2 - </b><i>‘Give known bonus in 3 months’</i>:  Asked on 10 January, after bonus is learned,
                to donate a portion of it, to be collected in three months.</li><br>
              <li style="text-align:justify"><b>B  - </b><i>‘Give from unknown bonus in 3 months’</i>:  Asked on 10 November (before they know what
                their bonus will be) to pledge a portion of their unanticipated potential bonus, conditionally
                on the size of the bonus, to be collected on 17 January.  Depending on feasibility, (i) the
                committed amount could be directly and automatically deducted from any bonus, or (ii) the employee
                could merely be reminded of their previous commitment after receiving their bonus.</li><br>

          <h2 class="text-center"> Spring 2018 Innovations in Fundraising Conference:<br><i>"When Professionals Win, Charities Thrive"</i></h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Purpose: Engage like-minded individuals from across sectors in the impact project ‘Innovations in Fundraising’ during our one-day
            Spring 2018 conference in London, sharing practical insights, experiences, issues and concerns. Our key initiative,
            "Give If You Win"</a>, connects employee bonuses with philanthropy.</b>The entire conference will last about six hours,
            including breaks and networking, but we welcome drop-in participants who can only spare an hour or so.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">The proposed outline is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRHjhOkUZUCGasVlMgAmXojazCXl0iWHmj16sI9dFKI8JZnyDra4-HJUMNwzDab3RK4kc_FOi6e12nD/pub">HERE</a>;
            your comments and suggestions are welcome.</p>
            <ul>
              <li style="text-align:justify">We will come together as finance and management professionals, academics, nonprofit workers, and philanthropists to share our knowledge
                and experience of what is possible, what works, and what is worth testing.</li><br>
              <li style="text-align:justify">We are targeting a real impact: this conference will be a success if it leads firms, fundraisers and researchers to plan specific tests and trials.</li><br>
              <li style="text-align:justify">Evidence from Dr. David Reinstein (Exeter Department of Economics) and others suggests that people are likely to be more generous with uncertain future
                income than with money they already have in the bank.</li><br>
              <li style="text-align:justify">In 2016, City Philanthropy held a <a href="http://www.cityphilanthropy.org.uk/events/1-bonus-pledge-think-tank">Bonus Pledge Think Tank</a> to consider ways to make the
                “City’s bonus pot become a force for good”, an application of "Give If You Win".</li><br>
              <li style="text-align:justify">“Give If You Win” has a very practical application for the financial sector - charitable fundraisers can ask for a commitment “if you earn a bonus, how much will you donate?“</li>
